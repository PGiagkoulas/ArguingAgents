* Jury size: enter 1 or 2 depending on your choice.
* Voting system: enter 1 or 2 depending on your choice.
* Number of arguments: enter the desired number of arguments (Evidence and Testimonies) for the simulation. Adhere to the suggested limits.
* Biased agents: enter 0 to maximum number of agents as selected on "Jury size". Represents the total number of biased agents in the jury.
* Low bias: enter 0 to maximum number of agents as selected in "Biased agents". These biased agents will have claims in their knowledge equal to 10% of total arguments.
* High bias: enter 0 to maximum number of agents as selected in "Biased agents". These biased agents will have claims in their knowledge equal to 20% of total arguments.

* Number of simulations: enter the desired number of simulations to run. Adhere to the suggested limits.
# Notice
* **Biased_agents_number = Low_bias_number + High_bias_number**
* **There are no user-input checks in place, so wrong selections can lead to unwanted results. Adhere to the suggested value limits**
